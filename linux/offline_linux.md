# Offline Access to Linux

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the auditorium, computers provide access to both Linux and Windows. The start-up screen may display either operating system. If you require access to Linux and the Windows login screen is displayed, you must first disconnect from Windows.

## Accessing Linux on the Auditorium Computers

1. **Switch to Linux Session**
   - If the Windows login screen is visible, press "Disconnect" to access the Linux terminal.

2. **Log in with One of the Accounts**
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Do not use Skoltech login data. Only local accounts!

   Enter your local account, NOT SKOLTECH data. Choose your login from stud01 to stud30, for example, stud09. The password is the same for all accounts.

   ```
   login: stud[01-30]
   password: skolstud
   ```

3. **Session Management**
   - Always **Log out** after your session.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Do not shut down the system!
