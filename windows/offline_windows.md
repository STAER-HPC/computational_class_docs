# Offline Access to Windows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the auditorium, computers provide access to both Linux and Windows. The start-up screen may display either operating system. If you require access to Windows, log out of Linux and enter the following credentials:
```
login: student
password: skolstud
```
> This will bring you to the Windows login screen, allowing you to proceed with the following steps.

## Accessing Windows on the Auditorium Computers

> [!NOTE]
> These compute units run a Linux host system with Windows as a virtual machine accessed via Remote Desktop Protocol.

1. **Unlock the Windows Session**
   - Ensure the Windows session is visible on the screen.

2. **Log in with Your Skoltech Account**
   - Enter your Skoltech account username and password, which are the same as your Skoltech email credentials.

   ```
   login: student.name@skoltech.ru
   password: <your_password_for_skoltech_account>
   ```

3. **Session Management**
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you want to finish your session, use **log out**. If you want to continue some process on background use **Disconect** option


## Use of Shared Storage

> [!CAUTION]
> The Windows virtual machines have a **storage limit of ~10GB per user**. If your files exceed this limit, use the **shared storage space**.

- Save your data in:
S:\Users\<student.name>

- Create the folder if it does not exist.
- You can access these files later from:
  - Any computer in the auditorium
  - Your personal computer (see [instructions](https://sci.skoltech.ru/eng_class/storage_windows))
