# Offline Access to Windows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the auditorium, computers provide access to both Linux and Windows. The start-up screen may display either operating system. If you require access to Windows, log out of Linux and enter the following credentials:
```
login: student
password: skolstud
```
> This will bring you to the Windows login screen, allowing you to proceed with the following steps.

## Accessing Windows on the Auditorium Computers

> [!NOTE]
> These compute units run a Linux host system with Windows as a virtual machine accessed via Remote Desktop Protocol.

1. **Unlock the Windows Session**
   - Ensure the Windows session is visible on the screen.

2. **Log in with Your Skoltech Account**
   - Enter your Skoltech account username and password, which are the same as your Skoltech email credentials.

   ```
   login: student.name@skoltech.ru
   password: <your_password_for_skoltech_account>
   ```

3. **Session Management**
   - Always **log out** after your session. Do not shut down the system.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Properly logging out keeps the system ready for the next user and maintains system stability.

## Use of Shared Storage

> [!CAUTION]
> Local data on the machine will be deleted within 30 days. To save your data, transfer it to your folder on the shared storage system.

   Information regarding the location of the shared storage and access instructions will be provided.

## Continuing Processes in the Background

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can continue running processes in the background and even connect remotely later to continue your work. However, only one user can interact with the screen at a time. If you encounter a message indicating someone has declined your request to take control of Windows, please wait until they finish their work.

   Instructions on how to log off properly should be included.
